  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following

#     # filter settings for services for this domain. This is very usable, if you want to connect a single RDS instance to multiple installations.
#     # So you can show some specific services only for some ownclouds and show other services to others. Domainname in only and except have to be the same as in domains
#     filters:
#       # example!
#       only: # only this services will be shown to users of this domain
#       - "layer1-port-zenodo"
#       except: # all other services will be shown to users of this domain
#       - "layer1-port-openscienceframework"
#       # if only and except are used at the same time, the system will filter for only first and then for except. So except should be a subset of only, otherwise it is doing nothing.

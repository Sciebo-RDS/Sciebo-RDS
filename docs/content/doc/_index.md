For a general understanding, what RDS is, what it does and how to use this documentation, you should read the following two sections.

## General conception

The project and target description can be found [here](/page/about/) and should be read carefully, too.
RDS was designed as a middleware, which make it easy to interact with different internal or external services within an already existing user interface.

Currently, there are only interfaces for owncloud and zenodo. More are coming soon.

## Getting started

If you are a user, you can look up [here](/doc/manual/faq/) for FAQ and tutorials.

But if you are an administrator, you can find an [installation guide here](/doc/getting-started/k8s/).

As a developer, your way to go is [here](/doc/arc42/indroduction/), where you will start with the arc42 documentation. After this, you can take a look into the autogenerated documentation of every microservice and the OpenAPIv3 specification.

If you have any further questions, do not hesitate and go to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Sciebo-RDS/Sciebo-RDS/issues).

## Workflow

We use Github as a repository for the source code. As CI/CD platform we use Gitlab and its own runners, which are also available to external people through a connection to the Github repository.
These are used automatically and its defined tasks are triggered as soon as a relevant line of code is changed. As a result of successful test cases, a container (currently we use Docker) is created, which is stored in Gitlab's internal package folder, so that Kubernetes can download and use the created containers from there. These packages are publicly available.

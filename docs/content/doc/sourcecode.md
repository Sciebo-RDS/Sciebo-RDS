The source code is currently available at [Github](https://github.com/Sciebo-RDS/Sciebo-RDS) and [Gitlab](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/sciebo-rds). Gitlab is a mirror image of Github. It is therefore recommended to use the github repository. Gitlab serves only as a platform for all CI/CD functions.

The documentation can be edited in two ways. The online version is recommended, since no installation of applications such as Git or Hugo is necessary.

## Online

Github provides the ability to directly edit the files that are in the Git repository. This is described in detail in their [documentation] (https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository). No applications other than a browser are required. Just navigate to the [Documentation folder in the RDS repository](https://github.com/Sciebo-RDS/Sciebo-RDS/tree/master/docs).

{{<callout "info">}}
Make sure that you create a new pull request when you save your changes or select the correct branch of your changes so that your changes can be viewed and applied by the developers. As long as there is no pull request, your changes cannot be applied.

### Folderstructure

In the [/docs](https://github.com/Sciebo-RDS/Sciebo-RDS/tree/master/docs) folder in the main Git repository directory, you'll find all the source code for the website you're currently viewing. The source code is processed by the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) program inside the Gitlab CI pipeline. A new folder named *public* is created and moved to the web server. This means that it is very easy to make changes to the documentation.

The */docs/content/doc* folder contains all the pages in [Markdown](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#learn-markdown) that constitute the technical documentation, which includes [the current file here](https://github.com/Sciebo-RDS/Sciebo-RDS/tree/master/docs/content/doc/contribute/documentation.de.md). 

In the other folders under */docs/content/content* news or articles (*/docs/content/post*), as well as various pages (*/docs/content/page*) outside the technical documentation can be created and edited.


## Offline

All that is required is to create a new [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with the necessary changes. Once the changes have been viewed and accepted, they will be available on the website.


Hugo offers many conveniences for creation and formatting. Further functions are also available through the [Theme](https://jimmyjames.github.io/justdocs/home/) used. Especially the callouts are especially helpful for the creation of clear texts.

You can view your changes locally with an installed Hugo application. The following command starts a server at [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313):

```bash
hugo server
```

# Constraints

## Boundary conditions

Most of the following boundary conditions have been taken directly from the application document or are implicitly described there.

| ID   | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RB-1 | The architecture is based on a modular approach, which is mainly supported by microservices.                                             |
| RB-2 | The focus is on the reusability of already existing developments.                                                                        |
| RB-3 | Current DevOps techniques are used (e.g. Gitlab, Docker and Kubernetes; CI/CD).                                                          |
| RB-4 | The project has to prove after 2 years (until 01.04.2021) that it has been used outside NRW and is completed after a maximum of 3 years. |
| RB-5 | All proprietary developments are also to be made available under an open source license in order to make the infrastructure sustainable. |
| RB-6 | The documentation of the architecture takes place in Arc42.                                                                              |
| RB-7 | The developed software stack can be operated in comparable university infrastructures without major adaptations.                         |
| RB-8 | Data protection according to DSGVO must be taken into account. (A main argument for Sciebo.)                                             |
| RB-9 | The project has only one publicly accessible IP address.                                                                                 |

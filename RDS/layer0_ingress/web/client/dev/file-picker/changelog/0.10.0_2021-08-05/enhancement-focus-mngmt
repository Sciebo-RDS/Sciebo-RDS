Enhancement: focus last breadcrumb item

We've added focus management so that the last breadcrumb item will be focused after a folder has been loaded.
By default, this focus management is disabled on the first load when opening the file picker.
To enable it also during the first load, set prop `isInitialFocusEnabled` to `true`.

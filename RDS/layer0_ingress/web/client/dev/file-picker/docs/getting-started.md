ownCloud File picker is a web component which can be integrated into existing web applications. It connects to an ownCloud server and enables a user to select resources which are then provided in a response of a fired event. Visit [installation]({{< ref "installation.md" >}}) to see how to integrate the File picker into your product.

## Components of the File picker
The file picker can be used in two different variations: File picker and location picker.

### File picker
The file picker enables users to select multiple resources and is intended to bring resources from within ownCloud into your web applications.

### Location picker
The location picker allows only one folder to be selected and its main purpose is to enable users to save files into the connected ownCloud instance.

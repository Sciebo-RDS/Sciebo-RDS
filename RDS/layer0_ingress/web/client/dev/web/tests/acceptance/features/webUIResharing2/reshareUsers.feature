# Reshare permission is not available now in the oCIS webUI
Feature: Resharing shared files with different permissions
  As a user
  I want to reshare received files and folders with other users with different permissions
  So that I can control the access on those files/folders by other collaborators

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And user "Brian" has created folder "simple-folder"

  Scenario: Reshare a folder without share permissions using API and check if it is listed on the collaborators list for original owner
    Given user "Brian" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice" with "read, share" permissions
    And user "Alice" has accepted the share "simple-folder" offered by user "Brian"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "Shares/simple-folder" with user "Carol" with "read" permissions
    And user "Carol" has accepted the share "simple-folder" offered by user "Alice"
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
    Then user "Carol King" should be listed as "Advanced permissions" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And no custom permissions should be set for collaborator "Carol King" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI

    When user "Carol" logs in using the webUI
    And the user opens folder "Shares" using the webUI
    Then the user should not be able to share folder "simple-folder" using the webUI

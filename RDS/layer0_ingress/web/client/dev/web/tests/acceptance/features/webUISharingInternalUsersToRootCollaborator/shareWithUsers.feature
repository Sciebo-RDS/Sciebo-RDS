Feature: Shares collaborator list
  As a user
  I want to check the collaborator list
  So that I can know the collaborators of a shared resource

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"

  Scenario Outline: change the collaborators of a file & folder
    Given user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/simple-folder" with user "Brian" with "<initial-permissions>" permissions
    When the user changes the collaborator role of "Brian Murphy" for folder "simple-folder" to "<set-role>" using the webUI
    # check role without reloading the collaborators panel, see issue #1786
    Then user "Brian Murphy" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list on the webUI
    # check role after reopening the collaborators panel
    And user "Brian Murphy" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "Brian" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                  |
      | uid_owner   | Alice                  |
      | share_with  | Brian                  |
      | file_target | /simple-folder         |
      | item_type   | folder                 |
      | permissions | <expected-permissions> |
    Examples:
      | initial-permissions | set-role             | expected-role | expected-permissions            |
      | read,update,create  | Viewer               | Viewer        | read,share                      |
      | read                | Editor               | Editor        | read,update,create,delete,share |
      | read,share          | Advanced permissions | Viewer        | read,share                      |
      | all                 | Advanced permissions | Editor        | all                             |

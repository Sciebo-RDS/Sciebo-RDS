Feature: Versions of a file

  As a user
  I would like to see different versions of a file and delete and restore them
  So that I can have more control over the files

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | user0    |
      | Alice    |

  @disablePreviews
  Scenario: upload new file with same name to see if different versions are shown
    Given user "user0" has logged in using the webUI
    And user "user0" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "lorem.txt"
    And the user has browsed to the files page
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "lorem content" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "new lorem content" to "lorem.txt"
    When the user browses to display the "versions" details of file "lorem.txt"
    Then the content of file "lorem.txt" for user "user0" should be "new lorem content"
    And the versions list should contain 2 entries


  Scenario: restoring file to old version changes the content of the file
    Given user "user0" has uploaded file with content "lorem content" to "lorem-file.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "new lorem content" to "lorem-file.txt"
    And user "user0" has logged in using the webUI
    And the user has browsed to the files page
    When the user browses to display the "versions" details of file "lorem-file.txt"
    And the user restores the file to last version using the webUI
    Then the content of file "lorem-file.txt" for user "user0" should be "lorem content"

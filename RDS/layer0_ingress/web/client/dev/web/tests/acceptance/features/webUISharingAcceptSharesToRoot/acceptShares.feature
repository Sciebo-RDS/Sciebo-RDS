Feature: accept/decline shares coming from internal users
  As a user
  I want to have control of which received shares I accept
  So that I can keep my file system clean

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI


  Scenario: reject a share that you received as user and as group member
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/simple-folder"

    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/simple-folder" with user "Brian"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/simple-folder" with group "grp1"
    And the user has browsed to the shared-with-me page

    Then folder "simple-folder" shared by "Alice Hansen" should be in "Declined" state on the webUI
    When the user browses to the files page
    Then folder "simple-folder" should not be listed on the webUI

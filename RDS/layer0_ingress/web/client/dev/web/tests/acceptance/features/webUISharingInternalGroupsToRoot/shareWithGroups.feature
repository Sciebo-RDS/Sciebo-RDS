Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal groups
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with groups
  So that those groups can access the files and folders

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | grp1      |
      | grp11     |
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"


  Scenario: share a folder with multiple collaborators and check collaborator list order
    Given user "Carol" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Carol" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "grp11" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    And the user shares folder "simple-folder" with user "Brian Murphy" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    And the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "grp1" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    And the user shares folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice Hansen" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    Then the current collaborators list should have order "Carol King,Alice Hansen,Brian Murphy,grp1,grp11"


  Scenario Outline: share a file & folder with another internal user
    Given user "Carol" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Carol" has created file "simple-folder/lorem.txt"
    And user "Carol" has uploaded file "testavatar.jpg" to "testavatar.jpg"
    And user "Carol" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "grp1" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "testavatar.jpg" with group "grp1" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    Then group "grp1" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And group "grp1" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for file "testavatar.jpg" on the webUI
    And user "Alice" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                |
      | uid_owner   | Carol                |
      | share_with  | grp1                 |
      | file_target | /simple-folder       |
      | item_type   | folder               |
      | permissions | <permissions-folder> |
    And user "Brian" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value              |
      | uid_owner   | Carol              |
      | share_with  | grp1               |
      | file_target | /testavatar.jpg    |
      | item_type   | file               |
      | permissions | <permissions-file> |
    And as "Alice" these resources should be listed on the webUI
      | entry_name     |
      | simple-folder  |
      | testavatar.jpg |
    And these resources should be listed in the folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
      | entry_name |
      | lorem.txt  |
    But these resources should not be listed in the folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
      | entry_name    |
      | simple-folder |
    When the user browses to the shared-with-me page using the webUI
    Then folder "simple-folder" should be marked as shared by "Carol King" on the webUI
    And file "testavatar.jpg" should be marked as shared by "Carol King" on the webUI
    Examples:
      | set-role             | expected-role        | permissions-folder              | permissions-file  |
      | Viewer               | Viewer               | read,share                      | read,share        |
      | Editor               | Editor               | read,update,create,delete,share | read,update,share |
      | Advanced permissions | Advanced permissions | read                            | read              |

    # overwrite the received shared file
    When the user uploads overwriting file "new-lorem.txt" using the webUI
    Then file "new-lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI
    And as "Alice" the content of "new-lorem.txt" should be the same as the content of local file "new-lorem.txt"
    # unshare the received shared file

    And user "Alice" should have received a share with target "lorem.txt" and expiration date in 42 days
    And user "Brian" should have received a share with target "lorem.txt" and expiration date in 42 days


  Scenario Outline: share a resource with another internal group with expiration date beyond maximum enforced expiration date
    Given the setting "shareapi_default_expire_date_group_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And the setting "shareapi_enforce_expire_date_group_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"

    And user "Carol" has created <element> "<shared-resource>"
    And user "Carol" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user tries to share resource "<shared-resource>" with group "grp1" which expires in "+6" days using the webUI
    Then the expiration date shown on the webUI should be "+5" days
    And user "Alice" should not have created any shares
    Examples:
      | element | shared-resource |
      | file    | lorem.txt       |
      | folder  | simple-folder   |


  Scenario Outline: share a resource with another internal group with expiration date within maximum enforced expiration date

      | expireDate      | +4                |
    And user "Carol" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user tries to edit the collaborator expiry date of "grp1" of resource "<shared-resource>" to "+7" days using the webUI
    Then the expiration date shown on the webUI should be "+4" days
    And it should not be possible to save the pending share on the webUI
    And user "Alice" should have received a share with target "<shared-resource>" and expiration date in 4 days
    And user "Brian" should have received a share with target "<shared-resource>" and expiration date in 4 days
    Examples:
      | element | shared-resource |
      | file    | lorem.txt       |
      | folder  | simple-folder   |

Feature: Federation Sharing - sharing with users on other cloud storages
  As a user
  I want to share files with any users on other cloud storages
  So that other users have access to these files

  Background:
    Given app "notifications" has been enabled
    And the setting "auto_accept_trusted" of app "federatedfilesharing" has been set to "yes" on remote server
    And the setting "auto_accept_trusted" of app "federatedfilesharing" has been set to "no"
    And server "%remote_backend_url%" has been added as trusted server
    And server "%backend_url%" has been added as trusted server
    And server "%backend_url%" has been added as trusted server on remote server
    And server "%remote_backend_url%" has been added as trusted server on remote server
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files on remote server
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI


  Scenario: test the single steps of sharing a folder to a remote server
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-empty-folder"
    And user "Alice" has created file "simple-folder/lorem.txt"
    And the user has reloaded the current page of the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with remote user "Alice" as "Editor" using the webUI
    And the user shares folder "simple-empty-folder" with remote user "Alice" as "Editor" using the webUI
    Then as "Alice" folder "/simple-folder" should exist on remote server
    And as "Alice" file "/simple-folder/lorem.txt" should exist on remote server
    And as "Alice" folder "/simple-empty-folder" should exist on remote server

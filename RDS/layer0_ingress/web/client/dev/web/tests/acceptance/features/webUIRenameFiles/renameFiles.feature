Feature: rename files
  As a user
  I want to rename files
  So that I can organise my data structure

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "data.zip" to "data.zip"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "lorem-big.txt" to "lorem-big.txt"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    And the user has browsed to the files page

Feature: Shares in share-with pages
  As a user
  I want to check share-with pages
  So that I can know what is shared with me and by me

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"

  Scenario: share a folder with other user and then it should be listed on Shared with You for other user
    Given user "Alice" has created file "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has renamed folder "simple-folder" to "new-simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has renamed file "lorem.txt" to "ipsum.txt"
    And user "Alice" has shared file "ipsum.txt" with user "Brian"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "new-simple-folder" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user browses to the shared-with-me page
    Then file "ipsum.txt" should be listed on the webUI
    And folder "new-simple-folder" should be listed on the webUI


  Scenario: share a folder with other user and then it should be listed on Shared with Others page
    Given user "Carol" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created file "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    And user "Alice" has shared file "lorem.txt" with user "Brian"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Brian"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Carol"
    When the user browses to the shared-with-others page
    Then the following resources should have the following collaborators
      | fileName      | expectedCollaborators     |
      | lorem.txt     | Brian Murphy              |
      | simple-folder | Brian Murphy, Carol King  |

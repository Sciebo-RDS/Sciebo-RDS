Feature: move files
  As a user
  I want to move files
  So that I can organise my data structure

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "lorem.txt"


  Scenario: An attempt to move a file into a sub-folder using rename is not allowed
    Given user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    And the user has browsed to the files page
    When the user tries to rename file "lorem.txt" to "simple-folder/lorem.txt" using the webUI
    Then the error message 'The name cannot contain "/"' should be displayed on the webUI dialog prompt
    And file "lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI

    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "data.zip" to "testapp.zip"
    And the user has browsed to the files page
    When the user batch moves these files into folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
      | file_name   |

    And the user renames folder "simple-folder" to <folder_name> using the webUI

    Then breadcrumb for folder <folder_name> should be displayed on the webUI
    And file <file_name> should be listed on the webUI
    Examples:
      | file_name   | folder_name             |
      | "'single'"  | "folder-with-'single'"  |

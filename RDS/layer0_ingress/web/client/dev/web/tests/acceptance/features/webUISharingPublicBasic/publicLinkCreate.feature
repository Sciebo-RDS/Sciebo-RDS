Feature: Create public link shares
  As a user
  I want to share files through a publicly accessible link

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user creates a new public link for resource "simple-folder" using the webUI
    Then user "Alice" should have a share with these details:
      | field       | value              |
      | share_type  | public_link        |

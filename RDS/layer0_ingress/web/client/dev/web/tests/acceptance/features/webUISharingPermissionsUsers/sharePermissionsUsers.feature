Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal users with different permissions
  As a user
  I want to set different permissions on shared files and folders with other users
  So that I can control the access on those files/folders by other collaborators

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Brian" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "simple-empty-folder"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "simple-folder/simple-empty-folder"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file "data.zip" to "data.zip"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "simple-folder/lorem.txt"

  Scenario: Change permissions of the previously shared folder to read, share
    Given user "Brian" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice" with "read" permissions
    And user "Alice" has accepted the share "simple-folder" offered by user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI
    Then no custom permissions should be set for collaborator "Alice Hansen" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    When the user sets custom permission for current role of collaborator "Alice Hansen" for folder "simple-folder" to "share" using the webUI
    Then user "Alice" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                 |
      | uid_owner   | Brian                 |
      | share_with  | Alice                 |
      | file_target | /Shares/simple-folder |
      | item_type   | folder                |
      | permissions | read, share           |

    Then custom permissions "share, create, delete" should be set for user "Alice Hansen" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    When the user sets custom permission for current role of collaborator "Alice Hansen" for folder "simple-folder" to "create, delete, share" using the webUI
    Then custom permission "share, create, delete" should be set for user "Alice Hansen" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI

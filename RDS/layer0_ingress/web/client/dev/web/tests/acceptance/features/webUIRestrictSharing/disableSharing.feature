Feature: disable sharing
  As an admin
  I want to be able to disable the sharing function
  So that users cannot share files

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "simple-folder/lorem.txt"

  Scenario: Users tries to share via WebUI when Sharing is disabled
    Given the setting "shareapi_enabled" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    When user "Alice" logs in using the webUI
    Then it should not be possible to share folder "simple-folder" using the webUI


  Scenario: Users tries to share from favorites page when sharing is disabled
    Given the setting "shareapi_enabled" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And user "Alice" has favorited element "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has favorited element "simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI

Feature: Resharing shared files with different permissions
  As a user
  I want to reshare received files and folders with other users with different permissions
  So that I can control the access on those files/folders by other collaborators

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And user "Brian" has created folder "simple-folder"


  Scenario: Reshare a folder without share permissions using API and check if it is listed on the collaborators list for original owner
    Given user "Brian" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice" with "read, share" permissions
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Carol" with "read" permissions
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
    Then user "Carol King" should be listed as "Advanced permissions" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And no custom permissions should be set for collaborator "Carol King" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI


  Scenario: Reshare a folder without share permissions using API and check if it is listed on the collaborators list for resharer
    Given user "Brian" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice" with "read, share" permissions
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Carol" with "read" permissions
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
    Then user "Carol King" should be listed as "Advanced permissions" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And no custom permissions should be set for collaborator "Carol King" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI


  Scenario: Reshare a folder without share permissions using API and check if the receiver can reshare
    Given user "Brian" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice" with "read, share" permissions
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Carol" with "read" permissions
    When user "Carol" logs in using the webUI
    Then the user should not be able to share folder "simple-folder" using the webUI


  Scenario Outline: share a received folder with another user with same permissions(including share permissions) and check if the user is displayed in collaborators list for resharer
    Given user "Brian" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice" with "<permissions>" permissions
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with user "Carol King" as "<role>" with permissions "<collaborators-permissions>" using the webUI
    Then user "Carol King" should be listed as "<displayed-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And custom permissions "<displayed-permissions>" should be set for user "Carol King" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "Carol" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value              |
      | uid_owner   | Alice              |
      | share_with  | Carol              |
      | file_target | /simple-folder     |
      | item_type   | folder             |
      | permissions | <permissions>      |

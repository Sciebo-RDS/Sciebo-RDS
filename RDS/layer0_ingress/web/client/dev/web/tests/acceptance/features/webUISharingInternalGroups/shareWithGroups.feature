Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal groups
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with groups
  So that those groups can access the files and folders

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And group "grp1" has been created
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"


  Scenario: share a folder with multiple collaborators and check collaborator list order
    Given group "grp11" has been created
    And user "Carol" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Carol" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "grp11" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    And the user shares folder "simple-folder" with user "Brian Murphy" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    And the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "grp1" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    And the user shares folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice Hansen" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    Then the current collaborators list should have order "Carol King,Alice Hansen,Brian Murphy,grp1,grp11"

  Scenario Outline: share a file & folder with another internal user
    Given user "Carol" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Carol" has created file "simple-folder/lorem.txt"
    And user "Carol" has created file "testimage.jpg"
    And user "Carol" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "grp1" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "testimage.jpg" with group "grp1" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    And user "Alice" accepts the share "simple-folder" offered by user "Carol" using the sharing API
    And user "Brian" accepts the share "simple-folder" offered by user "Carol" using the sharing API
    And user "Alice" accepts the share "testimage.jpg" offered by user "Carol" using the sharing API
    And user "Brian" accepts the share "testimage.jpg" offered by user "Carol" using the sharing API
    Then group "grp1" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And group "grp1" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for file "testimage.jpg" on the webUI
    And user "Alice" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                 |
      | uid_owner   | Carol                 |
      | share_with  | grp1                  |
      | file_target | /Shares/simple-folder |
      | item_type   | folder                |
      | permissions | <permissions-folder>  |
    And user "Brian" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                 |
      | uid_owner   | Carol                 |
      | share_with  | grp1                  |
      | file_target | /Shares/testimage.jpg |
      | item_type   | file                  |
      | permissions | <permissions-file>    |
    And as "Alice" these resources should be listed in the folder "Shares" on the webUI
      | entry_name    |
      | simple-folder |
      | testimage.jpg |
    And these resources should be listed in the folder "/Shares%2Fsimple-folder" on the webUI
      | entry_name |
      | lorem.txt  |
    But these resources should not be listed in the folder "/Shares%2Fsimple-folder" on the webUI
      | entry_name    |
      | simple-folder |
    When the user browses to the shared-with-me page using the webUI
    Then folder "simple-folder" should be marked as shared by "Carol King" on the webUI
    And file "testimage.jpg" should be marked as shared by "Carol King" on the webUI
    Examples:
      | set-role             | expected-role        | permissions-folder              | permissions-file  |
      | Viewer               | Viewer               | read,share                      | read,share        |
      | Editor               | Editor               | read,update,create,delete,share | read,update,share |
      | Advanced permissions | Advanced permissions | read                            | read              |

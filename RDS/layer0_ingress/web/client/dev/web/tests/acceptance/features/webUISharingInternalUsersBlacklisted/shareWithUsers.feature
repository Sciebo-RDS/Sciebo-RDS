Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal users
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with other users
  So that those users can access the files and folders

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario: member of a blacklisted from sharing group tries to re-share a file or folder received as a share
    Given user "Carol" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Carol" has uploaded file "testavatar.jpg" to "testimage.jpg"
    And user "Carol" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And group "grp1" has been created
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Carol" has shared file "testimage.jpg" with user "Alice"
    And user "Alice" has accepted the share "testimage.jpg" offered by user "Carol"
    And user "Carol" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice"
    And user "Alice" has accepted the share "simple-folder" offered by user "Carol"
    And the administrator has enabled exclude groups from sharing
    And the administrator has excluded group "grp1" from sharing
    When user "Alice" logs in using the webUI
    And the user opens folder "Shares" using the webUI
    Then the user should not be able to share file "testimage.jpg" using the webUI
    And the user should not be able to share folder "simple-folder" using the webUI

    And user "Carol" has created folder "common"
    And user "Carol" has moved file "testimage.jpg" to "common/testimage.jpg"
    And user "Carol" has shared folder "common" with user "Alice"
    And user "Alice" has accepted the share "common" offered by user "Carol"
    And the administrator has enabled exclude groups from sharing
    And the administrator has excluded group "grp1" from sharing
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    And the user has opened folder "Shares"
    When the user opens folder "common" using the webUI

Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal users with expiry date
  As a user
  I want to be able to set an expiry date on my shares
  So that I don't have to remember to unshare

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario: share a file with another internal user which should expire after 2 days
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "testavatar.jpg" to "testimage.jpg"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares file "testimage.jpg" with user "Brian Murphy" which expires in "+2" days using the webUI
    Then user "Brian" should have received a share with target "testimage.jpg" and expiration date in 2 days


  Scenario: share a file with another internal user with default expiration date
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "testavatar.jpg" to "testimage.jpg"
    And the setting "shareapi_default_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And default expiration date for users is set to 3 days
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares file "testimage.jpg" with user "Brian Murphy" using the webUI
    Then user "Brian" should have received a share with target "testimage.jpg" and expiration date in 3 days


  Scenario: change existing expiration date of an existing share with another internal user
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created a new share with following settings
      | path       | lorem.txt |
      | shareWith  | Brian     |
      | expireDate | +14       |
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user edits the collaborator expiry date of "Brian Murphy" of file "lorem.txt" to "+7" days using the webUI
    Then user "Brian" should have received a share with target "lorem.txt" and expiration date in 7 days
    And user "Alice" should have a share with these details:
      | field      | value      |
      | path       | /lorem.txt |
      | share_type | user       |
      | uid_owner  | Alice      |
      | share_with | Brian      |
      | expiration | +7         |


  Scenario: share a resource with another internal user with expiration date within enforced maximum expiration date
    Given the setting "shareapi_default_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And the setting "shareapi_enforce_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And the setting "shareapi_expire_after_n_days_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "5"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares file "lorem.txt" with user "Brian Murphy" which expires in "+4" days using the webUI
    Then user "Alice" should have a share with these details:
      | field      | value      |
      | path       | /lorem.txt |
      | share_type | user       |
      | uid_owner  | Alice      |
      | share_with | Brian      |
      | expiration | +4         |


  Scenario Outline: share a resource with another internal user with expiration date beyond enforced maximum expiration date
    Given the setting "shareapi_default_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And the setting "shareapi_enforce_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And the setting "shareapi_expire_after_n_days_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "5"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user tries to share resource "<shared-resource>" with user "Brian Murphy" which expires in "+6" days using the webUI
    Then the expiration date shown on the webUI should be "+5" days
    And user "Alice" should not have created any shares
    Examples:
      | shared-resource |
      | lorem.txt       |
      | simple-folder   |


  Scenario Outline: edit a share with another internal user changing expiration date within enforced maximum expiration date
    Given the setting "shareapi_default_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And the setting "shareapi_enforce_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And the setting "shareapi_expire_after_n_days_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "5"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has created a new share with following settings
      | path       | <shared-resource> |
      | shareWith  | Brian             |
      | expireDate | +4                |
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user tries to edit the collaborator expiry date of "Brian Murphy" of resource "<shared-resource>" to "+7" days using the webUI
    Then the expiration date shown on the webUI should be "+4" days
    And it should not be possible to save the pending share on the webUI
    Examples:
      | shared-resource |
      | lorem.txt       |
      | simple-folder   |


  Scenario: user cannot concurrently update the role and date of a share after the system maximum expiry date has been reduced
    Given the setting "shareapi_default_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And the setting "shareapi_enforce_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And the setting "shareapi_expire_after_n_days_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "30"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created a new share with following settings
      | path             | lorem.txt |
      | shareWith        | Brian     |
      | expireDate       | +30       |
      | permissionString | read      |
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    And the setting "shareapi_expire_after_n_days_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "10"
    When the user tries to edit the collaborator "Brian Murphy" of file "lorem.txt" changing following
      | expireDate       | +15    |
      | permissionString | Editor |
    Then the user should see an error message on the collaborator share dialog saying "Cannot set expiration date more than 10 days in the future"
    And user "Alice" should have a share with these details:
      | field       | value      |
      | path        | /lorem.txt |
      | share_type  | user       |
      | uid_owner   | Alice      |
      | share_with  | Brian      |
      | expiration  | +30        |
      | permissions | read       |

Feature: restrict Sharing
  As an admin
  I want to be able to restrict the sharing function
  So that users can only share files with specific users and groups

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And these users have been created with initialization and without skeleton files:
      | username | password  | displayname   | email             |
      | Alison   | %regular% | Alison Cooper | alson@oc.com.np |
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | grp1      |
      | grp2      |
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Carol" has been added to group "grp2"
    And user "Alison" has been added to group "grp2"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file "lorem.txt" to "simple-folder/lorem.txt"
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: Restrict users to only share with users in their groups
    Given the setting "shareapi_only_share_with_group_members" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    When the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
    And the user opens the share creation dialog in the webUI
    And the user types "Ali" in the share-with-field
    Then "user" "Alison Cooper" should not be listed in the autocomplete list on the webUI
    But "user" "Alice Hansen" should be listed in the autocomplete list on the webUI

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: Restrict users to only share with groups they are member of
    Given the setting "shareapi_only_share_with_membership_groups" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    When the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
    And the user opens the share creation dialog in the webUI
    And the user types "grp" in the share-with-field
    Then "group" "grp2" should not be listed in the autocomplete list on the webUI
    But "group" "grp1" should be listed in the autocomplete list on the webUI


  Scenario: Do not restrict users to only share with groups they are member of
    Given the setting "shareapi_only_share_with_membership_groups" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "grp2" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    And user "Carol" accepts the share "simple-folder" offered by user "Brian" using the sharing API
    Then as "Carol" folder "/Shares/simple-folder" should exist

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: Forbid sharing with groups
    Given the setting "shareapi_allow_group_sharing" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    When the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
    And the user opens the share creation dialog in the webUI
    And the user types "grp" in the share-with-field
    Then "group" "grp1" should not be listed in the autocomplete list on the webUI
    And "group" "grp2" should not be listed in the autocomplete list on the webUI

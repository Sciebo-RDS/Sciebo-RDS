  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with other users
  So that those users can access the files and folders

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |

  Scenario Outline: share a file & folder with another internal user
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Brian" has created file "simple-folder/lorem.txt"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file "testavatar.jpg" to "testimage.jpg"
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice Hansen" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "testimage.jpg" with user "Alice Hansen" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    Then user "Alice Hansen" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "Alice Hansen" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for file "testimage.jpg" on the webUI
    And user "Alice" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                |
      | uid_owner   | Brian                |
      | share_with  | Alice                |

    And as "Alice" these resources should be listed on the webUI
      | entry_name    |
      | simple-folder |
      | testimage.jpg |
    When the user opens the share dialog for file "simple-folder" using the webUI
    Then user "Brian Murphy" should be listed as "Owner" in the collaborators list on the webUI
    When the user opens the share dialog for file "testimage.jpg" using the webUI
    Then user "Brian Murphy" should be listed as "Owner" in the collaborators list on the webUI

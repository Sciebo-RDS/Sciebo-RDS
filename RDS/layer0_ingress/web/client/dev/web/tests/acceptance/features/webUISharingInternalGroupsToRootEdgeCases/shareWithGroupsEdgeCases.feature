Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal groups
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with groups
  So that those groups can access the files and folders

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And user "Carol" has created folder "simple-folder"

  Scenario Outline: sharing  files and folder with an internal problematic group name
    Given user "Carol" has uploaded file "testavatar.jpg" to "testavatar.jpg"
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | <group>   |
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "<group>"
    And user "Carol" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "<group>" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "testavatar.jpg" with group "<group>" as "Viewer" using the webUI
    Then group "<group>" should be listed as "Viewer" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And group "<group>" should be listed as "Viewer" in the collaborators list for file "testavatar.jpg" on the webUI
    When the user re-logs in as "Alice" using the webUI
    Then folder "simple-folder" should be listed on the webUI
    When the user opens the share dialog for file "simple-folder" using the webUI
    Then user "Carol King" should be listed as "Owner" in the collaborators list on the webUI
    And file "testavatar.jpg" should be listed on the webUI
    When the user opens the share dialog for file "testavatar.jpg" using the webUI
    Then user "Carol King" should be listed as "Owner" in the collaborators list on the webUI
    Examples:
      | group     |
      | ?\?@#%@,; |
      | नेपाली      |

    And the user opens the share creation dialog in the webUI
    And the user types "Alice" in the share-with-field
    Then "group" "Alice" should not be listed in the autocomplete list on the webUI

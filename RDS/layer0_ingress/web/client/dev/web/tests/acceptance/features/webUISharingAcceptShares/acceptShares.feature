Feature: accept/decline shares coming from internal users
  As a user
  I want to have control of which received shares I accept
  So that I can keep my file system clean

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI

 @issue-ocis-1950
  Scenario: reject a share that you received as user and as group member
    Given these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | grp1      |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/simple-folder"
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/simple-folder" with user "Brian"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/simple-folder" with group "grp1"
    And the user has browsed to the shared-with-me page
    When the user declines share "simple-folder" offered by user "Alice Hansen" using the webUI
    Then folder "simple-folder" shared by "Alice Hansen" should be in "Declined" state on the webUI
    When the user browses to the files page
    Then folder "/Shares" should not be listed on the webUI

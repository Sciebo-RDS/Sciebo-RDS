# Reshare permission is not available now in the oCIS webUI
Feature: Resharing shared files with different permissions
  As a user
  I want to reshare received files and folders with other users with different permissions
  So that I can control the access on those files/folders by other collaborators

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And user "Brian" has created folder "simple-folder"

  Scenario: share a folder with another user with share permissions and reshare without share permissions to different user, and check if user is displayed for original sharer
    Given user "Brian" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "Alice" with "read, share" permissions

    And the user re-logs in as "Brian" using the webUI
    Then user "Carol King" should be listed as "Viewer" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And no custom permissions should be set for collaborator "Carol King" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "Alice Hansen" should be listed as "Viewer" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "Alice" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                 |
      | uid_owner   | Brian                 |

      | item_type   | folder                |
      | permissions | read, share           |

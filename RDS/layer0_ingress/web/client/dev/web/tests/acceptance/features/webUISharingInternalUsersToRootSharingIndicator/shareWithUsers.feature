Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal users
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with other users
  So that those users can access the files and folders

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"

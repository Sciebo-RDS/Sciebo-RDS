Feature: Locks
  As a user
  I would like to be able to use locks control upload of files and folders
  So that I can prevent files and folders being added to and changed while they are being used by another user

  Background:
    #do not set email, see bugs in https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/32250#issuecomment-434615887
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username       |
      | brand-new-user |
    And user "brand-new-user" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "brand-new-user" has uploaded file with content "file inside locked folder" to "simple-folder/lorem.txt"
    And user "brand-new-user" has uploaded file with content "locked file" to "lorem.txt"
    And user "brand-new-user" has logged in using the webUI

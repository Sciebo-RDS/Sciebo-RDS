Feature: files and folders can be deleted from the trashbin
  As a user
  I want to delete files and folders from the trashbin
  So that I can control my trashbin space and which files are kept in that space

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    Given user "Alice" has created file "lorem.txt"
    Given user "Alice" has created file "lorem-big.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created file "sample,1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "Folder,With,Comma"
    And user "Alice" has created file "simple-folder/lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created file "simple-folder/lorem-big.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "data.zip" to "data.zip"
    And the following files have been deleted by user "Alice"
      | name              |
      | lorem.txt         |
      | simple-folder     |
      | sample,1.txt      |
      | lorem-big.txt     |
      | Folder,With,Comma |

Change: File actions as accordion item in right sidebar

We moved the menu items from `file actions` dropdown menu (the "three dots menu") as accordion item into the right sidebar and made it the default item to be opened when clicking the three dots.
For the sake of consistency we now also made the right sidebar available for the `Deleted files` page, where we offer the actions accordion item with a `Restore` and `Delete` action.

Bugfix: Make available file actions (more) aware of the page context

The list of available file actions sometimes contained actions which should not be possible and sometimes was missing actions that should be possible. Most important examples are that copy/move should not be available on `shared with me` and `shared with others` pages (but they were) and that the set of file actions from the `All files` page should also be available for the favorites page (but were not).

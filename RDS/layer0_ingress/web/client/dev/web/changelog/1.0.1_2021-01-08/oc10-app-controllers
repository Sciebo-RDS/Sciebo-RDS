Change: Add controllers for oc10 app deployment

We added a config endpoint for when ownCloud Web is deployed as ownCloud 10 app. The config.json file must not be placed in the apps folder because it would cause the app integrity check to fail.
In addition to the config endpoint we added a wildcard endpoint for serving static assets (js bundles, css, etc) of the ownCloud Web javascript application by their paths.

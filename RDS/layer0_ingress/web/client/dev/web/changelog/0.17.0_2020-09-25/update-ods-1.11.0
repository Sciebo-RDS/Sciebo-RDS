Change: Update ODS to 1.11.0

We updated owncloud design system (ODS) to 1.11.0. This brings some features and required some changes:
- Buttons:
    - require to be placed in a grid or with uk-flex for side by side positioning,
    - don't have an icon property anymore,
    - have a slot so that content of the button can be just anything
    - placement of the content in the button can be modified with new props `justify-content` and `gap`
- new icons, which are used in the sidebar and for quick actions
- sidebar has a property for hiding the navigation. It doesn't have internal logic anymore for hiding the navigation automatically.

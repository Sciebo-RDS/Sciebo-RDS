Change: Join users and groups into a single list in collaborators sidebar

Users and groups were shown as two separate lists (users, then groups) in the collaborators sidebar.
This separation is now removed, i.e. there is only one list with all collaborators, sorted by display name
(lower case, ascending). On equal names groups are shown first.

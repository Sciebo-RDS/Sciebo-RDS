Change: Improve ownCloud Design System (ODS)

During the work on this release, there have been several changes in ODS which directly affect Web.
- Proper text truncate in breadcrumb component. This fixes the mobile view of the current folder breadcrumb in the top bar.
- New icon sizes `xlarge` and `xxlarge` in oc-icon component. Those are used for the `No content` messages e.g. when navigating to an empty folder.
- Provide new icon size `xsmall` and align spinner-sizes with icon-sizes. The `xsmall` icon size turned out to be prettier in some places. The size alignments fixed layout glitches when removing collaborators or public links.
- Fix aria label on spinner in oc-autocomplete. Warning were cluttering the JavaScript console when adding collaborators.
- Reset input on selection in oc-autocomplete, when `fillOnSelection=false`. This makes sure that when a new collaborator has been selected, the search input field goes back to being blank for a new search.

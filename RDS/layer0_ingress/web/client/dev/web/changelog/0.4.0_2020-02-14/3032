Bugfix: Properly manage escaping of all translations

We've stopped escaping translations which contained resource names or user names because they can contain special characters which were then not properly displayed.
We've done this only with translations which are using mustache syntax which does escaping on its own so we don't introduce poteintial XSS vulnerability.
For all other translations, we've explicitly set the escaping.

Bugfix: Public link glitches

We fixed a couple of glitches with public links:
- Creating a folder in a public link context was showing an error message although the folder was created correctly. This was happening because reloading the current folder didn't
take the public link context into account.
- For public links with editor role the batch actions at the top of the files list were not showing. The public links route didn't have a specific flag for showing the batch actions.
- Quick actions for sharing are not available in public link contexts by design. The check printed an error in the javascript console though. We made this check silent now.

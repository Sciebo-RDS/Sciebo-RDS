Bugfix: Fixed layout of file lists

A recent library update in ODS for the recycle scroller seem to have
changed the logic or calculation of the height.

This fix accomodates for that change and restores the row height to a
correct value.

The shared file lists are now more responsive, the collaborators/owner
and share time columns are now hidden on small screens.

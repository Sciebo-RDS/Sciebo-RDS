## Details

* Bugfix - Panic when service fails to start: [#2252](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2252)

   Tags: runtime

   When attempting to run a service through the runtime that is currently running and fails to
   start, a race condition still redirect os Interrupt signals to a closed channel.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2252

* Bugfix - Dont use port 80 as debug for GroupsProvider: [#2271](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2271)

   A copy/paste error where the configuration for the groupsprovider's debug address was not
   present leaves go-micro to start the debug service in port 80 by default.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2271

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v3.4.0: [#2276](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2276)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v3.4.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2276
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v3.4.0

* Change - Update WEB to v3.4.1: [#2283](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2283)

  * Fix [5501](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5501): loading previews in the right sidebar
  * Fix [5493](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5493): view options position

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2283
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v3.4.1

* Enhancement - Runtime support for cherry picking extensions: [#2229](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2229)

   Support for running certain extensions supervised via cli flags. Example usage:

   ``` > ocis server --extensions="proxy, idp, storage-metadata, accounts" ```

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2229

* Enhancement - Add readonly mode for storagehome and storageusers: [#2230](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2230)

   To enable the readonly mode use `STORAGE_HOME_READ_ONLY=true` and
   `STORAGE_USERS_READ_ONLY=true`. Alternative: use `OCIS_STORAGE_READ_ONLY=true`

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2230

* Enhancement - Remove unnecessary Service.Init(): [#1705](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1705)

   As it turns out oCIS already calls this method. Invoking it twice would end in accidentally
   resetting values.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1705

* Enhancement - Update REVA to v1.9.1-0.20210628143859-9d29c36c0c3f: [#2227](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2227)

# Changelog for [1.8.0] (2021-06-28)

The following sections list the changes for 1.8.0.

[1.8.0]: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0

## Summary

* Bugfix - External storage registration used wrong config: [#2120](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2120)
* Bugfix - Remove authentication from /status.php completely: [#2188](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2188)
* Bugfix - Make webdav namespace configurable across services: [#2198](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2198)
* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v3.3.0: [#2187](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2187)
* Enhancement - Properly configure graph-explorer client registration: [#2118](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2118)
* Enhancement - Use system default location to store TLS artefacts: [#2129](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2129)
* Enhancement - Update REVA to v1.9: [#2205](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2205)

## Details

* Bugfix - External storage registration used wrong config: [#2120](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2120)

   The go-micro registry-singleton ignores the ocis configuration and defaults to mdns

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2120

* Bugfix - Remove authentication from /status.php completely: [#2188](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2188)

   Despite requests without Authentication header being successful, requests with an invalid
   bearer token in the Authentication header were rejected in the proxy with an 401
   unauthenticated. Now the Authentication header is completely ignored for the /status.php
   route.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8538
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2188

* Bugfix - Make webdav namespace configurable across services: [#2198](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2198)

   The WebDAV namespace is used across various services, but it was previously hardcoded in some
   of the services. This PR uses the same environment variable to set the config correctly across
   the services.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2198

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v3.3.0: [#2187](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2187)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v3.3.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2187
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v3.3.0

* Enhancement - Properly configure graph-explorer client registration: [#2118](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2118)

   The client registration in the `identifier-registration.yaml` for the graph-explorer
   didn't contain `redirect_uris` nor `origins`. Both were added to prevent exploitation.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2118

* Enhancement - Use system default location to store TLS artefacts: [#2129](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2129)

   This used to default to the current location of the binary, which is not ideal after a first run as
   it leaves traces behind. It now uses the system's location for artefacts with the help of
   https://golang.org/pkg/os/#UserConfigDir.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2129

* Enhancement - Update REVA to v1.9: [#2205](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2205)

   This update includes * [set Content-Type
   correctly](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1750) * [Return file checksum
   available from the metadata for the EOS
   driver](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1755) * [Sort share entries
   alphabetically](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1772) * [Initial work on the
   owncloudsql driver](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1710) * [Add user ID cache
   warmup to EOS storage driver](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1774) * [Use
   UidNumber and GidNumber fields in User
   objects](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1573) * [EOS GRPC
   interface](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1471) * [switch
   references](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1721) * [remove user's uuid from
   trashbin file key](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1793) * [fix restore behavior of
   the trashbin API](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1795) * [eosfs: add arbitrary
   metadata support](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1811)

## Details

* Bugfix - Change the groups index to be case sensitive: [#2109](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2109)

   Groups are considered to be case sensitive. The index must handle them case sensitive too
   otherwise we will have undeterministic behavior while editing or deleting groups.

* Enhancement - Announce user profile picture capability: [#2036](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2036)

   Added a new capability (through https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1694) to prevent the
   web frontend from fetching (nonexistent) user avatar profile pictures which added latency &
   console errors.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2036

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.7.1-0.20210531093513-b74a2b156af6: [#2104](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2104)

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix STORAGE_METADATA_ROOT default value override: [#1956](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1956)

   The way the value was being set ensured that it was NOT being overridden where it should have
   been. This patch ensures the correct loading order of values.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1956

* Bugfix - Stop the supervisor if a service fails to start: [#1963](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1963)

   Steps to make the supervisor fail:

   `PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9144 bin/ocis server`

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1963

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v3.1.0: [#2045](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2045)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v3.1.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2045
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v3.1.0

* Enhancement - Added dictionary files: [#2003](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2003)

   Added the dictionary.js file for package settings and accounts which contains strings that
   should be synced to transifex but not exist in the UI directly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/2003

* Enhancement - Introduce login form with h1 tag for screen readers only: [#1991](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1991)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1991

* Enhancement - User Deprovisioning for the OCS API: [#1962](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1962)

   Use the CS3 API and Reva to deprovision users completely.

   Two new environment variables introduced: ``` OCS_IDM_ADDRESS OCS_STORAGE_USERS_DRIVER
   ```

   `OCS_IDM_ADDRESS` is also an alias for `OCIS_URL`; allows the OCS service to mint jwt tokens
   for the authenticated user that will be read by the reva authentication middleware.

   `OCS_STORAGE_USERS_DRIVER` determines how a user is deprovisioned. This kind of behavior is
   needed since every storage driver deals with deleting differently.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1962

* Enhancement - Support thumbnails for txt files: [#1988](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1988)

   Implemented support for thumbnails for txt files in the thumbnails service.

* Enhancement - Remove dead runtime code: [#1923](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1923)

   When moving from the old runtime to the new one there were lots of files left behind that are
   essentially dead code and should be removed. The original code lives here
   github.com/refs/pman/ if someone finds it interesting to read.

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix thumbnail generation for jpegs: [#1785](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1785)

   Images with the extension `.jpeg` were not properly supported.

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v2.1.0: [#1870](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1870)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v2.1.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

* Enhancement - Add focus to input elements on login page: [#1792](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1792)

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4322
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1792

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1794
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1811

* Enhancement - Add new build targets: [#1824](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1824)

   Make build target `build` used to build a binary twice, the second occurrence having symbols
   for debugging. We split this step in two and added `build-all` and `build-debug` targets.

   - `build-all` now behaves as the previous `build` target, it will generate 2 binaries, one for
   debug. - `build-debug` will build a single binary for debugging.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1824

* Enhancement - Clarify expected failures: [#1790](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1790)

   Some features, while covered by the ownCloud 10 acceptance tests, will not be implmented for
   now: - blacklisted / ignored files, because ocis does not need to blacklist `.htaccess` files -
   `OC-LazyOps` support was [removed from the
   clients](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8398). We are thinking about [a state
   machine for uploads to properly solve that scenario and also list the state of files in progress
   in the web ui](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/214). The expected failures
   files now have a dedicated _Won't fix_ section for these items.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/214
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1790
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8398

* Enhancement - Replace special character in login page title with a regular minus: [#1813](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1813)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1813

* Enhancement - File Logging: [#1816](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1816)

   When running supervised, support for configuring all logs to a single log file:
   `OCIS_LOG_FILE=/Users/foo/bar/ocis.log MICRO_REGISTRY=etcd bin/ocis server`

   Supports directing log from single extensions to a log file:
   `PROXY_LOG_FILE=/Users/foo/bar/proxy.log MICRO_REGISTRY=etcd bin/ocis proxy`

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1816

* Enhancement - Runtime Hostname and Port are now configurable: [#1822](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1822)

   Without any configuration the ocis runtime will start on `localhost:9250` unless specified
   otherwise. Usage:

   - `OCIS_RUNTIME_PORT=6061 bin/ocis server` - overrides the oCIS runtime and starts on port
   6061 - `OCIS_RUNTIME_PORT=6061 bin/ocis list` - lists running extensions for the runtime on
   `localhost:6061`

   All subcommands are updated and expected to work with the following environment variables:

   ``` OCIS_RUNTIME_HOST OCIS_RUNTIME_PORT ```

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1822

* Enhancement - Generate thumbnails for .gif files: [#1791](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1791)

   Added support for gifs to the thumbnails service.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1791

* Enhancement - Tracing Refactor: [#1819](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1819)

   Centralize tracing handling per extension.

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.6.1-0.20210223065028-53f39499762e: [#1683](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1683)
* Enhancement - Add initial nats and kubernetes registry support: [#1697](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1697)

## Details

* Bugfix - Purposely delay accounts service startup: [#1734](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1734)

   As it turns out the race condition between `accounts <-> storage-metadata` still remains.
   This PR is a hotfix, and it should be followed up with a proper fix. Either:

   - block the accounts' initialization until the storage metadata is ready (using the registry)
   or - allow the accounts service to initialize and use a message broker to signal the accounts the
   metadata storage is ready to receive requests.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1734

* Bugfix - Add missing gateway config: [#1716](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1716)

   The auth provider `ldap` and `oidc` drivers now need to be able talk to the reva gateway. We added
   the `gatewayscv` to the config that is passed to reva.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1716

* Bugfix - Fix accounts initialization: [#1696](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1696)

   Originally the accounts service relies on both the `settings` and `storage-metadata` to be up
   and running at the moment it starts. This is an antipattern as it will cause the entire service to
   panic if the dependants are not present.

   We inverted this dependency and moved the default initialization data (i.e: creating roles,
   permissions, settings bundles) and instead of notifying the settings service that the
   account has to provide with such options, the settings is instead initialized with the options
   the accounts rely on. Essentially saving bandwith as there is no longer a gRPC call to the
   settings service.

   For the `storage-metadata` a retry mechanism was added that retries by default 20 times to
   fetch the `com.owncloud.storage.metadata` from the service registry every `500`
   miliseconds. If this retry expires the accounts panics, as its dependency on the
   `storage-metadata` service cannot be resolved.

   We also introduced a client wrapper that acts as middleware between a client and a server. For
   more information on how it works further read [here](https://github.com/sony/gobreaker)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1696

* Bugfix - Fix the ttl of the authentication middleware cache: [#1699](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1699)

   The authentication cache ttl was multiplied with `time.Second` multiple times. This
   resulted in a ttl that was not intended.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1699

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v2.0.1: [#1683](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1683)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v2.0.1. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1683
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v2.0.1

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v2.0.2: [#1776](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1776)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v2.0.2. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1776
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v2.0.2

* Enhancement - Remove the JWT from the log: [#1758](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1758)

   We were logging the JWT in some places. Secrets should not be exposed in logs so it got removed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1758

* Enhancement - Update go-micro to v3.5.1-0.20210217182006-0f0ace1a44a9: [#1670](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1670)

   - We updated from go micro v2 (v2.9.1) go-micro v3 (v3.5.1 edge). - oCIS runtime is now aware of
   `MICRO_LOG_LEVEL` and is set to `error` by default. This decision was made because ownCloud,
   as framework builders, want to log everything oCIS related and hide everything unrelated by
   default. It can be re-enabled by setting it to a log level other than `error`. i.e:
   `MICRO_LOG_LEVEL=info`. - Updated `protoc-gen-micro` to the [latest
   version](https://github.com/asim/go-micro/tree/master/cmd/protoc-gen-micro). -
   We're using Prometheus wrappers from go-micro.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1670
   https://github.com/asim/go-micro/pull/2126

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.6.1-0.20210223065028-53f39499762e: [#1683](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1683)

  * quota querying and tree accounting [cs3org/reva#1405](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1405)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1683
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1405

* Enhancement - Add initial nats and kubernetes registry support: [#1697](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1697)

   We added initial support to use nats and kubernetes as a service registry using
   `MICRO_REGISTRY=nats` and `MICRO_REGISTRY=kubernetes` respectively. Multiple nodes can
   be given with `MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8,9.10.11.12`.

* Enhancement - Make use of new design-system oc-table: [#1597](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1597)
* Enhancement - Use a default protocol parameter instead of explicitly disabling tus: [#1331](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1331)
* Enhancement - Functionality to map home directory to different storage providers: [#1186](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1186)

## Details

* Bugfix - Check if roles are present in user object before looking those up: [#1388](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1388)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1388

* Bugfix - Fix etcd address configuration: [#1546](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1546)

   The etcd server address in `MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` was not picked up when etcd was set as
   service discovery registry `MICRO_REGISTRY=etcd`. Therefore etcd was only working if
   available on localhost / 127.0.0.1.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1546

* Bugfix - Remove unimplemented config file option for oCIS root command: [#1636](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1636)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1636

* Bugfix - Fix thumbnail generation when using different idp: [#1624](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1624)

   The thumbnail service was relying on a konnectd specific field in the access token. This logic
   was now replaced by a service parameter for the username.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1624
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1628

* Change - Initial release of graph and graph explorer: [#1594](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1594)

   Tags: graph, graph-explorer

   We brought initial basic Graph and Graph-Explorer support for the ownCloud Infinite Scale
   project.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1594
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-graph-explorer/pull/3

* Change - Move runtime code on refs/pman over to owncloud/ocis/ocis: [#1483](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1483)

   Tags: ocis, runtime

   Currently, the runtime is under the private account of an oCIS developer. For future-proofing
   we don't want oCIS mission critical components to depend on external repositories, so we're
   including refs/pman module as an oCIS package instead.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1483

* Change - Update ownCloud Web to v2.0.0: [#1661](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1661)

   Tags: web

   We updated ownCloud Web to v2.0.0. Please refer to the changelog (linked) for details on the web
   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1661
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v2.0.0

* Enhancement - Make use of new design-system oc-table: [#1597](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1597)

   Tags: ui, accounts

   The design-system table component has changed the way it's used. We updated accounts-ui to use
   the new 'oc-table-simple' component.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1597

* Enhancement - Use a default protocol parameter instead of explicitly disabling tus: [#1331](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1331)

   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1331
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1374

* Enhancement - Functionality to map home directory to different storage providers: [#1186](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1186)

   We added a parameter in reva that allows us to redirect /home requests to different storage
   providers based on a mapping derived from the user attributes, which was previously not
   possible since we hardcode the /home path for all users. For example, having its value as
   `/home/{{substr 0 1 .Username}}` can be used to redirect home requests for different users to
   different storage providers.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1186
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1142

* Enhancement - Introduce ADR: [#1042](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1042)

   We will keep track of [Architectual Decision Records using
   Markdown](https://adr.github.io/madr/) in `/docs/adr`.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1042

* Enhancement - Switch to opencontainers annotation scheme: [#1381](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1381)

   Switch docker image annotation scheme to org.opencontainers standard because
   org.label-schema is depreciated.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1381

* Enhancement - Migrate ocis-graph-explorer to ocis monorepo: [#1596](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1596)

   Tags: ocis, ocis-graph-explorer

   Ocis-graph-explorer was not migrated during the monorepo conversion.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1596

* Enhancement - Migrate ocis-graph to ocis monorepo: [#1594](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1594)

   Tags: ocis, ocis-graph

   Ocis-graph was not migrated during the monorepo conversion.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1594

* Enhancement - Enable group sharing and add config for sharing SQL driver: [#1626](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1626)

   This PR adds config to support sharing with groups. It also introduces a breaking change for the
   CS3APIs definitions since grantees can now refer to both users as well as groups. Since we store
   the grantee information in a json file, `/var/tmp/ocis/storage/shares.json`, its previous
   version needs to be removed as we won't be able to unmarshal data corresponding to the previous
   definitions.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1626
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1453

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.5.2-0.20210125114636-0c10b333ee69: [#1482](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1482)

   release.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1191
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/releases/tag/v1.0.1

* Enhancement - Add OCIS_URL env var: [#1148](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1148)

   Tags: ocis

   We introduced a new environment variable `OCIS_URL` that expects a URL including protocol,
   host and optionally port to simplify configuring all the different services. These existing
   environment variables still take precedence, but will also fall back to `OCIS_URL`:
   `STORAGE_LDAP_IDP`, `STORAGE_OIDC_ISSUER`, `PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER`,
   `STORAGE_FRONTEND_PUBLIC_URL`, `KONNECTD_ISS`, `WEB_OIDC_AUTHORITY`, and
   `WEB_UI_CONFIG_SERVER`.

   Some environment variables are now built dynamically if they are not set: -
   `STORAGE_DATAGATEWAY_PUBLIC_URL` defaults to `<STORAGE_FRONTEND_PUBLIC_URL>/data`,
   also falling back to `OCIS_URL` - `WEB_OIDC_METADATA_URL` defaults to
   `<WEB_OIDC_AUTHORITY>/.well-known/openid-configuration`, also falling back to
   `OCIS_URL`

   Furthermore, the built in konnectd will generate an `identifier-registration.yaml` that
   uses the `KONNECTD_ISS` in the allowed `redirect_uris` and `origins`. It simplifies the
   default `https://localhost:9200` and remote deployment with `OCIS_URL` which is evaluated
   as a fallback if `KONNECTD_ISS` is not set.

   An oCIS server can now be started on a remote machine as easy as
   `OCIS_URL=https://cloud.ocis.test PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:443 ocis server`.

   Note that the `OCIS_DOMAIN` environment variable is not used by oCIS, but by the docker
   containers.

* Enhancement - Use sync.cache for roles cache: [#1367](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1367)

   Tags: ocis-pkg

   Update ocis-pkg/roles cache to use ocis-pkg/sync cache

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1367

* Enhancement - Add named locks and refactor cache: [#1212](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1212)

   Tags: ocis-pkg, accounts

   We had the case that we needed kind of a named locking mechanism which enables us to lock only
   under certain conditions. It's used in the indexer package where we do not need to lock
   everything, instead just lock the requested parts and differentiate between reads and
   writes.

   This made it possible to entirely remove locks from the accounts service and move them to the
   ocis-pkg indexer. Another part of this refactor was to make the cache atomic and write tests for
   it.

   - remove locking from accounts service - add sync package with named mutex - add named locking to
   indexer - move cache to sync package

* Enhancement - Update reva to v1.5.1: [#1372](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1372)

   Summary -------

  * Fix #1401: Use the user in request for deciding the layout for non-home DAV requests
  * Fix #1413: Re-include the '.git' dir in the Docker images to pass the version tag
  * Fix #1399: Fix ocis trash-bin purge
  * Enh #1397: Bump the Copyright date to 2021
  * Enh #1398: Support site authorization status in Mentix
  * Enh #1393: Allow setting favorites, mtime and a temporary etag
  * Enh #1403: Support remote cloud gathering metrics

   Details -------

  * Bugfix #1401: Use the user in request for deciding the layout for non-home DAV requests

   For the incoming /dav/files/userID requests, we have different namespaces depending on
   whether the request is for the logged-in user's namespace or not. Since in the storage drivers,
   we specify the layout depending only on the user whose resources are to be accessed, this fails
   when a user wants to access another user's namespace when the storage provider depends on the
   logged in user's namespace. This PR fixes that.

   For example, consider the following case. The owncloud fs uses a layout {{substr 0 1
   .Id.OpaqueId}}/{{.Id.OpaqueId}}. The user einstein sends a request to access a resource
   shared with him, say /dav/files/marie/abcd, which should be allowed. However, based on the
   way we applied the layout, there's no way in which this can be translated to /m/marie/.

  * Bugfix #1413: Re-include the '.git' dir in the Docker images to pass the version tag

   And git SHA to the release tool.

   Https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1413

  * Bugfix #1399: Fix ocis trash-bin purge

   Fixes the empty trash-bin functionality for ocis-storage

   Https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/254
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1399

  * Enhancement #1397: Bump the Copyright date to 2021

   Https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1397

  * Enhancement #1398: Support site authorization status in Mentix

   This enhancement adds support for a site authorization status to Mentix. This way, sites
   registered via a web app can now be excluded until authorized manually by an administrator.

   Furthermore, Mentix now sets the scheme for Prometheus targets. This allows us to also support
   monitoring of sites that do not support the default HTTPS scheme.

   Https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1398

  * Enhancement #1393: Allow setting favorites, mtime and a temporary etag

   We now let the oCIS driver persist favorites, set temporary etags and the mtime as arbitrary
   metadata.

   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/issues/1394
   https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1393

  * Enhancement #1403: Support remote cloud gathering metrics

   The current metrics package can only gather metrics either from json files. With this feature,
   the metrics can be gathered polling the http endpoints exposed by the owncloud/nextcloud
   sciencemesh apps.

   Https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1403

* Bugfix - Fix id or username query handling: [#745](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/745)

   Tags: accounts

   The code was stopping execution when encountering an error while loading an account by id. But
   for or queries we can continue execution.

* Bugfix - Fix konnectd build: [#809](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/809)

   Tags: konnectd

   We fixed the default config for konnectd and updated the Makefile to include the `yarn
   install`and `yarn build` steps if the static assets are missing.

* Bugfix - Use micro default client: [#718](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/718)

   Tags: glauth

   We found a file descriptor leak in the glauth connections to the accounts service. Fixed it by
   using the micro default client.

* Bugfix - Allow consent-prompt with switch-account: [#788](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/788)

   Multiple prompt values are allowed and this change fixes the check for select_account if it was
   used together with other prompt values. Where select_account previously was ignored, it is
   now processed as required, fixing the use case when a RP wants to trigger select_account first
   while at the same time wants also to request interactive consent.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/788

* Bugfix - Mint token with uid and gid: [#737](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/737)

   Tags: accounts

   The eos driver expects the uid and gid from the opaque map of a user. While the proxy does mint
   tokens correctly, the accounts service wasn't.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/737

* Bugfix - Serve index.html for directories: [#912](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/912)

   The static middleware in ocis-pkg now serves index.html instead of returning 404 on paths with
   a trailing `/`.

   Tags: accounts

   We don't allow anymore to create a new account if the provided id/mail/username is already
   taken.

* Bugfix - Permission checks for settings write access: [#1092](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1092)

   Tags: settings

   There were several endpoints with write access to the settings service that were not protected
   by permission checks. We introduced a generic settings management permission to fix this for
   now. Will be more fine grained later on.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1092

* Bugfix - Fix minor ui bugs: [#1043](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1043)

   - the ui haven't updated the language of the items in the settings view menu. Now we listen to the
   selected language and update the ui - deduplicate resetMenuItems call

* Bugfix - Disable public link expiration by default: [#987](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/987)

   Tags: storage

   The public link expiration was enabled by default and didn't have a default expiration span by
   default, which resulted in already expired public links coming from the public link quick
   action. We fixed this by disabling the public link expiration by default.

   Tags: docker

   ARM builds were failing when built on alpine:edge, so we switched to alpine:latest instead.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/416

* Change - Accounts UI shows message when no permissions: [#656](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/656)

   We improved the UX of the accounts UI by showing a message information the user about missing
   permissions when the accounts or roles fail to load. This was showing an indeterminate
   progress bar before.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/656

* Change - Cache password validation: [#958](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/958)

   Tags: accounts

   The password validity check for requests like `login eq '%s' and password eq '%s'` is now cached
   for 10 minutes. This improves the performance for basic auth requests.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/958

* Change - Filesystem based index: [#709](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/709)

   Tags: accounts, storage

   We replaced `bleve` with a new filesystem based index implementation. There is an `indexer`
   which is capable of orchestrating different index types to build indices on documents by
   field. You can choose from the index types `unique`, `non-unique` or `autoincrement`.
   Indices can be utilized to run search queries (full matches or globbing) on document fields.
   The accounts service is using this index internally to run the search queries coming in via
   `ListAccounts` and `ListGroups` and to generate UIDs for new accounts as well as GIDs for new
   groups.

   The accounts service can be configured to store the index on the local FS / a NFS (`disk`
   implementation of the index) or to use an arbitrary storage ( `cs3` implementation of the
   index). `cs3` is the new default, which is configured to use the `metadata` storage.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/709

* Change - Rebuild index command for accounts: [#748](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/748)

   Tags: accounts

   The index for the accounts service can now be rebuilt by running the cli command `./bin/ocis
   accounts rebuild`. It deletes all configured indices and rebuilds them from the documents
   found on storage. For this we also introduced a `LoadAccounts` and `LoadGroups` function on
   storage for loading all existing documents.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/748

* Change - Add the thumbnails command: [#156](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/156)

   Tags: thumbnails

   Added the thumbnails command so that the thumbnails service can get started via ocis.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/156

* Change - CS3 can be used as accounts-backend: [#1020](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1020)

   Tags: proxy

   PROXY_ACCOUNT_BACKEND_TYPE=cs3 PROXY_ACCOUNT_BACKEND_TYPE=accounts (default)

   By using a backend which implements the CS3 user-api (currently provided by reva/storage) it
   is possible to bypass the ocis-accounts service and for example use ldap directly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1020

* Change - Use bcrypt to hash the user passwords: [#510](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/510)

   Change the hashing algorithm from SHA-512 to bcrypt since the latter is better suitable for
   password hashing. This is a breaking change. Existing deployments need to regenerate the
   accounts folder.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/510

* Change - Replace the library which scales the images: [#910](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/910)

   The library went out of support. Also did some refactoring of the thumbnails service code.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/910

* Change - Choose disk or cs3 storage for accounts and groups: [#623](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/623)

   Tags: accounts

   The accounts service now has an abstraction layer for the storage. In addition to the local disk
   implementation we implemented a cs3 storage, which is the new default for the accounts
   service.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/623

* Change - Improve reva service descriptions: [#536](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/536)

   Tags: docs

   The descriptions make it clearer that the services actually represent a mount point in the
   combined storage. Each mount point can have a different driver.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/536

* Change - Initial release of basic version: [#2](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2)

   Just prepared an initial basic version which simply embeds the minimum of required services in
   the context of the ownCloud Infinite Scale project.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2

* Change - Add cli-commands to manage accounts: [#115](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/115)

   Tags: accounts

   user-account information.

* Change - Properly style konnectd consent page: [#754](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/754)

   Tags: konnectd

   After bringing our theme into konnectd, we've had to adjust the styles of the consent page so the
   text is visible and button reflects our theme.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/754

* Change - Make all paths configurable and default to a common temp dir: [#1080](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1080)

   Aligned all services to use a dir following`/var/tmp/ocis/<service>/...` by default. Also
   made some missing temp paths configurable via env vars and config flags.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1080

* Change - Move the indexer package from ocis/accounts to ocis/ocis-pkg: [#794](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/794)

   We are making that change for semantic reasons. So consumers of any index don't necessarily
   need to know of the accounts service.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/794

* Change - Switch over to a new custom-built runtime: [#287](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/287)

   We moved away from using the go-micro runtime and are now using [our own
   runtime](https://github.com/refs/pman). This allows us to spawn service processes even
   when they are using different versions of go-micro. On top of that we now have the commands `ocis
   list`, `ocis kill` and `ocis run` available for service runtime management.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/287

* Change - Move ocis default config to root level: [#842](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/842)

   Tags: ocis

   We moved the tracing config to the `root` flagset so that they are parsed on all commands. We also
   introduced a `JWTSecret` flag in the root flagset, in order to apply a common default JWTSecret
   to all services that have one.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/842
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/843

* Change - Remove username field in OCS: [#709](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/709)

   Tags: ocs

   We use the incoming userid as both the `id` and the `on_premises_sam_account_name` for new
   accounts in the accounts service. The userid in OCS requests is in fact the username, not our
   internal account id. We need to enforce the userid as our internal account id though, because
   the account id is part of various `path` formats.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/709
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/816

* Change - Account management permissions for Admin role: [#124](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/124)

   Tags: accounts, settings

   We created an `AccountManagement` permission and added it to the default admin role. There are
   permission checks in place to protected http endpoints in ocis-accounts against requests
   without the permission. All existing default users (einstein, marie, richard) have the
   default user role now (doesn't have the `AccountManagement` permission). Additionally,
   there is a new default Admin user with credentials `moss:vista`.

   Known issue: for users without the `AccountManagement` permission, the accounts UI
   extension is still available in the ocis-web app switcher, but the requests for loading the
   users will fail (as expected). We are working on a way to hide the accounts UI extension if the
   user doesn't have the `AccountManagement` permission.

   We changed the default apps for ownCloud Web to be only files and media-viewer.
   Markdown-editor and draw-io have been removed as defaults.

* Change - Proxy allow insecure upstreams: [#1007](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1007)

   Tags: proxy

   We can now configure the proxy if insecure upstream servers are allowed. This was added since
   you need to disable certificate checks fore some situations like testing.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1007

* Change - Make ocis-settings available: [#287](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/287)

   Tags: settings

   This version delivers `settings` as a new service. It is part of the array of services in the
   `server` command.

* Change - Unify Configuration Parsing: [#675](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/675)

   Tags: ocis

   - responsibility for config parsing should be on the subcommand - if there is a config file in the
   environment location, env var should take precedence - general rule of thumb: the more
   explicit the config file is that would be picked up. Order from less to more explicit: - config
   location (/etc/ocis) - environment variable - cli flag

   After renaming ocsi-reva to storage and combining the storage and data providers some env vars

   env vars to `STORAGE_DRIVER_...`. This makes changing the storage driver using eg.:
   `STORAGE_HOME_DRIVER=eos` and setting driver options using
   `STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_LAYOUT=...` less confusing.

   Previously, the auth and user provider services used to have the same driver, which restricted
   using separate drivers and configs for both. This PR separates the two and adds the config for
   the rest user driver and the gatewaysvc parameter to EOS fs.

  * Bugfix - Update LDAP filters: [#399](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/399)

   With the separation of use and find filters we can now use a filter that taken into account a users
   uuid as well as his username. This is necessary to make sharing work with the new account service
   which assigns accounts an immutable account id that is different from the username.
   Furthermore, the separate find filters now allows searching users by their displayname or
   email as well.

   ``` userfilter =
   "(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(|(ownclouduuid={{.OpaqueId}})(cn={{.OpaqueId}})))"
   findfilter =
   "(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(|(cn={{query}}*)(displayname={{query}}*)(mail={{query}}*)))"
   ```

  * Change - Environment updates for the username userid split: [#420](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/420)

   We updated the owncloud storage driver in reva to properly look up users by userid or username
   using the userprovider instead of taking the path segment as is. This requires the user service
   address as well as changing the default layout to the userid instead of the username. The latter
   is not considered a stable and persistent identifier.

  * Enhancement - Add TUS global capability: [#177](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/177)

   The TUS global capabilities from Reva are now exposed.

   The advertised max chunk size can be configured using the "--upload-max-chunk-size" CLI
   switch or "REVA_FRONTEND_UPLOAD_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE" environment variable. The advertised
   http method override can be configured using the "--upload-http-method-override" CLI
   switch or "REVA_FRONTEND_UPLOAD_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE" environment variable.

  * Bugfix - Stop advertising unsupported chunking v2: [#145](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/145)

   Removed "chunking" attribute in the DAV capabilities. Please note that chunking v2 is
   advertised as "chunking 1.0" while chunking v1 is the attribute "bigfilechunking" which is
   already false.

  * Enhancement - Use a configured logger on reva runtime: [#153](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/153)

   For consistency reasons we need a configured logger that is inline with an ocis logger, so the
   log cascade can be easily parsed by a human.

  * Bugfix - Fix eos user sharing config: [#127](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/127)

   We have added missing config options for the user sharing manager and added a dedicated eos
   storage command with pre configured settings for the eos-docker container. It configures a
   `Shares` folder in a users home when using eos as the storage driver.

  * Bugfix - Set correct flag type in the flagsets: [#75](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/75)

   While upgrading to the micro/cli version 2 there where two instances of `StringFlag` which had
   not been changed to `StringSliceFlag`. This caused `ocis-reva users` and `ocis-reva
   storage-root` to fail on startup.

  * Bugfix - Allow different namespaces for /webdav and /dav/files: [#68](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/68)

   After fbf131c the path for the "new" webdav path does not contain a username
   `/remote.php/dav/files/textfile0.txt`. It used to be
   `/remote.php/dav/files/oc/einstein/textfile0.txt` So it lost `oc/einstein`.

   This PR allows setting up different namespaces for `/webav` and `/dav/files`:

   `/webdav` is jailed into `/home` - which uses the home storage driver and uses the logged in user
   to construct the path `/dav/files` is jailed into `/oc` - which uses the owncloud storage
   driver and expects a username as the first path segment

   This mimics oc10

   The `WEBDAV_NAMESPACE_JAIL` environment variable is split into - `WEBDAV_NAMESPACE` and -
   `DAV_FILES_NAMESPACE` accordingly.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/68 related:

  * Change - Use /home as default namespace: [#68](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/68)

   Currently, cross storage etag propagation is not yet implemented, which prevents the desktop
   client from detecting changes via the PROPFIND to /. / is managed by the root storage provider
   which is independend of the home and oc storage providers. If a file changes in /home/foo, the
   etag change will only be propagated to the root of the home storage provider.

   This change jails users into the `/home` namespace, and allows configuring the namespace to
   use for the two webdav endpoints using the new environment variable `WEBDAV_NAMESPACE_JAIL`
   which affects both endpoints `/dav/files` and `/webdav`.

   This will allow us to focus on getting a single storage driver like eos or owncloud tested and
   better resembles what owncloud 10 does.

   To get back the global namespace, which ultimately is the goal, just set the above environment
   variable to `/`.

  * Change - Initial release of basic version: [#1](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/1)

   Just prepared an initial basic version to start a reva server and start integrating with the
   go-micro base dextension framework of ownCloud Infinite Scale.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/1

  * Change - Start multiple services with dedicated commands: [#6](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/6)

   The initial version would only allow us to use a set of reva configurations to start multiple
   services. We use a more opinionated set of commands to start dedicated services that allows us
   to configure them individually. It allows us to switch eg. the user backend to LDAP and fully use
   it on the cli.

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/6

  * Change - Storage providers now default to exposing data servers: [#89](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/89)

   The flags that let reva storage providers announce that they expose a data server now defaults
   to true:

   `REVA_STORAGE_HOME_EXPOSE_DATA_SERVER=1` `REVA_STORAGE_OC_EXPOSE_DATA_SERVER=1`

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/89

  * Change - Default to running behind ocis-proxy: [#113](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/113)

   We changed the default configuration to integrate better with ocis.

   - We use ocis-glauth as the default ldap server on port 9125 with base `dc=example,dc=org`. - We
   use a dedicated technical `reva` user to make ldap binds - Clients are supposed to use the
   ocis-proxy endpoint `https://localhost:9200` - We removed unneeded ocis configuration
   from the frontend which no longer serves an oidc provider. - We changed the default user
   OpaqueID attribute from `sub` to `preferred_username`. The latter is a claim populated by
   konnectd that can also be used by the reva ldap user manager to look up users by their OpaqueId

  * Enhancement - Expose owncloud storage driver config in flagset: [#87](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/87)

   - autocreate home path for new users default: `true` env var:
   `REVA_STORAGE_OWNCLOUD_AUTOCREATE` cli option: `--storage-owncloud-autocreate`

   - the address of the redis server default: `:6379` env var:
   `REVA_STORAGE_OWNCLOUD_REDIS_ADDR` cli option: `--storage-owncloud-redis`

   Reva has seen a lot of changes that allow us to - reduce the configuration overhead - use the
   autocreato home folder option - use the home folder path layout option - no longer start the root
   storage

   Https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/91 related:

  * Enhancement - Allow configuring user sharing driver: [#115](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/pull/115)

   We now default to `json` which persists shares in the sharing manager in a json file instead of an
   in memory db.

* Enhancement - Better adopt Go-Micro: [#840](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/840)

   Tags: ocis

   There are a few building blocks that we were relying on default behavior, such as
   `micro.Registry` and the go-micro client. In order for oCIS to work in any environment and not
   relying in black magic configuration or running daemons we need to be able to:

   - Provide with a configurable go-micro registry. - Use our own go-micro client adjusted to our
   own needs (i.e: custom timeout, custom dial timeout, custom transport...)

   This PR is relying on 2 env variables from Micro: `MICRO_REGISTRY` and
   `MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`. The latter does not make sense to provide if the registry is not
   `etcd`.

   The current implementation only accounts for `mdns` and `etcd` registries, defaulting to
   `mdns` when not explicitly defined to use `etcd`.

* Enhancement - Add permission check when assigning and removing roles: [#879](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/879)

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/886

* Enhancement - Add glauth fallback backend: [#649](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/649)

   We introduced the `fallback-datastore` config option and the corresponding options to allow
   configuring a simple chain of two handlers.

   Simple, because it is intended for bind and single result search queries. Merging large sets of
   results is currently out of scope. For now, the implementation will only search the fallback
   backend if the default backend returns an error or the number of results is 0. This is sufficient
   to allow an IdP to authenticate users from ocis as well as owncloud 10 as described in the [bridge
   scenario](https://owncloud.github.io/ocis/deployment/bridge/).

* Enhancement - Launch a storage to store ocis-metadata: [#602](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/602)

   Tags: metadata, accounts, settings

   In the future accounts, settings etc. should be stored in a dedicated metadata storage. The
   services should talk to this storage directly, bypassing reva-gateway.

* Enhancement - Add a version command to ocis: [#915](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/915)

   The version command was only implemented in the extensions. This adds the version command to
   ocis to list all services in the ocis namespace.

* Enhancement - Cache userinfo in proxy: [#877](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/877)

   Tags: proxy

   We introduced caching for the userinfo response. The token expiration is used for cache
   invalidation if available. Otherwise we fall back to a preconfigured TTL (default 10
   seconds).

* Enhancement - Update OCIS Runtime: [#1108](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1108)

   - enhances the overall behavior of our runtime - runtime `db` file configurable - two new env
   variables to deal with the runtime - `RUNTIME_DB_FILE` and `RUNTIME_KEEP_ALIVE` -
   `RUNTIME_KEEP_ALIVE` defaults to `false` to provide backwards compatibility - if
   `RUNTIME_KEEP_ALIVE` is set to `true`, if a supervised process terminates the runtime will
   attempt to start with the same environment provided.

* Enhancement - Simplify tracing config: [#92](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/92)

   We now apply the oCIS tracing config to all services which have tracing. With this it is possible
   to set one tracing config for all services at the same time.

* Enhancement - Add www-authenticate based on user agent: [#1009](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/1009)

   Tags: reva, proxy

   We now comply with HTTP spec by adding Www-Authenticate headers on every `401` request.
   Furthermore, we not only take care of such a thing at the Proxy but also Reva will take care of it.
   In addition, we now are able to lock-in a set of User-Agent to specific challenges.

   Admins can use this feature by configuring oCIS + Reva following this approach:

   ``` STORAGE_FRONTEND_MIDDLEWARE_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_BY_USER_AGENT="mirall:basic,
   Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:83.0) Gecko/20100101
   Firefox/83.0:bearer" \
   PROXY_MIDDLEWARE_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_BY_USER_AGENT="mirall:basic, Mozilla/5.0
   (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:83.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/83.0:bearer" \
   PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH=true \ go run cmd/ocis/main.go server ```

   We introduced two new environment variables:

   `STORAGE_FRONTEND_MIDDLEWARE_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_BY_USER_AGENT` as well as
   `PROXY_MIDDLEWARE_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_BY_USER_AGENT`, The reason they have the same value
   is not to rely on the os env on a distributed environment, so in redundancy we trust. They both
   configure the same on the backend storage and oCIS Proxy.

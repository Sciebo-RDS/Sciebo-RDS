## Build the documentation

{{< hint info >}}
For building the documentation you need to have Make and Go 1.14 or higher installed.
{{< /hint >}}

Just run `make -C docs docs-serve` from within the root level of the oCIS git repository. This will make documentation available on [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) and also do a hot reload if you change something in the (non autogenerated) documentation files.

## Add changes to the documentation

Please keep this documentation in sync with the oCIS source code.

Changes on the documentation are automatically applied to [this site]({{< ref "../" >}}) when merged to the master branch.
